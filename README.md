# Adversarial Defenses in NLP

This repository contains code and resources for a project on implementing adversarial defenses for transformer-based models in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The goal of this project is to explore methods to enhance the robustness of NLP models against adversarial attacks, particularly for tasks like text classification and Named Entity Recognition (NER).

## Project Overview

NLP systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks where slight modifications to input text can lead to incorrect predictions. This project implements three key adversarial defense strategies:
1. **Adversarial Training**: Augmenting the dataset with adversarial examples to improve the model's resilience.
2. **Input Preprocessing (Input Transformation)**: Neutralizing adversarial perturbations through techniques such as synonym replacement and noise reduction.
3. **Ensemble Methods**: Combining predictions from multiple models (e.g., BERT, Electra) using majority voting or probability averaging to improve robustness.

## Project Structure

- `notebooks/`: Contains the main Jupyter notebook where the models are trained, adversarial examples are generated, and defenses are tested.
- `models/`: A folder to store the saved model checkpoints after adversarial training.
- `data/`: A folder to hold datasets used in training and evaluation.
- `results/`: This folder will store evaluation results (accuracy, F1-scores, confusion matrices) from different adversarial defense strategies.
- `logs/`: A folder to store logs from training and evaluation experiments.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/adversarial-nlp-defense.git
   cd adversarial-nlp-defense
