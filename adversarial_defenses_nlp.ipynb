Most of these movies may not have the best plots or best actors but I enjoy these kinds of movies for what they are. This movie is much better than any of the movies the other action guys (Segal and Dolph) have thought about putting out the past few years. Van Damme is good in the movie, the movie is only worth watching to Van Damme fans. It is not as good as Wake of Death (which i highly recommend to anyone of likes Van Damme) or In hell but, in my opinion it's worth watching. It has the same type of feel to it as Nowhere to Run. Good fun stuff!\n",
      "Adversarial: Early off gonna me talk, Except you haven't cared a From Mah scene unless bloodsport, you undoubtedly yearning not like this moviemaking. More of these cinematographic may not fi the exemplary charting or maxima agents but I pleasures these guy of teatro for what they are. This cine is noticeably enhancement than any of the drama the other procedures fellers (Segal and Marella) receive thoughts about putting out the antigua restrained seniors. Van Damme is satisfactory in the photograph, the theatrical is only pena glance to Vehicles Mah partisans. It is not as guten as Arousing of Mortality (which i remarkably recommend to anyone of iove Van Damme) or In goddamned but, in my believing it's worth watch.

All passably acted but again nothing special.<br /><br />I thought the main villains were pretty well done and fairly well acted. By the end of the movie you certainly knew who the good guys were and weren't. There was an emotional lift as the really bad ones got their just deserts.
